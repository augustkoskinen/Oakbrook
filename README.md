This is a repository for a small, woodland-based roguelike game.

The game revolves around the idea of collecting cards and other items to get progressively more powerful as the battles from fight to fight get progressively harder as well. Each game, the player can use coins to activate powers in the cards the player has, such as attacks, shields, or other spcial actions. The player can along their journey gain more hearts, better cards, items called totems, and other artifacts that assist in their path.
